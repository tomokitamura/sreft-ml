# SReFT-ML
This repository is a Python library for Statistical Restoration of Fragmented Time course - Machine Learning (SReFT-ML). SReFT-ML is a neural network-based method for constructing long-term disease progression models from short-term observational data. It updates the SReFT algorithm to a machine learning-based approach. For detailed information about the concept of SReFT, please refer to [the original paper](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.1166).
